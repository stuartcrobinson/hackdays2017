NEED FILES:



for a user whose data spans over large time period (weeks, months years), use all data as one user but ALSO separate data as though
it comprises several users.  one user per smaller time period (like over a few hours to simulate specific preferences).  do for both lightfm and LSTM



MASTER INPUT FILES - create from bronto data -

- master browse file

userID, itemID, url, timestamp

- master orders file

userID, itemID, timestamp

- master item features file:

itemID, title, url, description


--- timeCode?

timeCode is an integer.... this is so stupid.  just get whole time stamp.  talk to tom asap.  yass talked to tom he says i can keep timestamps :))))

A.  FOR LIGHTFM - time-blind

use browse and orders data.  weight orders higher.  or use higher score/ranking for orders?

1.  user/item interactions:

userID, itemID, weight or score

2.  item features

itemID, features (list of strings)



B.  FOR SEQUENCE NEXT PRODUCT PREDICTION

use browse data only

1.  training sequence (a specific sequence of browsed products.  some representing user's entire browses.  some, a user browses over shorter time frame.
